## About the Game

"The Memory Game" is an online game inspired by any classic memory game!
It is designed to entertain busy people that have no time for long gaming hours, full of involvement and commitment.
This game is the perfect break for the nostalgic busy millenial parent, but people of all ages will find it easy-going and enjoyable.
The game can be accessed by a link on the browser and different levels bring a little bit of challenge to the experience as the gamer progresses with the possibility to see their final score.
## Planning phase
### User Experience (UX)
#### User stories
As a [type of user], I want [an action] so that [a reason/a value]
**First Time Visitor Goals**
1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to immediately understand the main purpose of the site. 
2. I want to be able to quickly understand the game controls and mechanics in order to enjoy playing the game
3. I want to find more information about the game and to be able to consult the game instructions. 
4. I want to be able to see my score as I play the game.
5. I want to be able to be challenged with harder levels as I progress.
6. I would like to play a simple game, with a fairly short play time, but high entertaining value.
7. I want to see my final score.
8. I want to have fun and feel inclined to play it again or at a later time.
Considering that there is no possibility to login and make a previous score better at the moment, all users are considered "first time visitors".
#### Strategy
<details>
<summary>Project Goals</summary>
The purpose of this project is to build an interactive website, using JavaScript. The website should have fun colors and provide good entertainment value. The user should feel good about playing the game and want to play it again immediately after or at a later time.
Although it is a simple game, in comparison to what is available today, this game has the nostalgic appeal of a classic memory game. In this project, the main goal is to make sure that the user decides to play the game and can the game mechanics. 
</details>
<details>
<summary>Business Goals</summary>
The main goal of the website is to offer a game to attract players. 
The game is free, but this is a good way to test for features before potentially developing it further or even creating a paid version. Developing and deploying a game in this manner can save time, by just "shipping it" with the MVP (minimun viable product) and later iterating and improving it little by little.
**Audience:** the game targets mainly busy nostalgic "millenials" - people in the age range 25-40. 
However, people of all ages can enjoy the game. Basic knowledge of English is helpful to read the "instructions" , but not a requirement to play.
While most people all over the world alrealdy know somewhat how to play this game, due to the popularity of the memory games, our main audience consists of busy and nostalgic "millenial" parents. Therefore our marketing language is adapted to this group of people.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Customer Goals</summary>
Prospective players / first website visitors: get to know the game, decide to play and enjoy the playing experience. The game should instill the desire to play again immediately after a game session or at a later time.
One main goal is for the player to have such a fun experience that they will recommend it to friends and family, by sharing the link of the game.
In the future, after testing the free version, the players might be able to have a paid version available with extra fun features.

###### Imagry
- The overall design should be quite clean and straightforward with focus on the functionality. The game should convey a sense of relaxaction and also mental stimulation. 

## Responsiveness
- Responsive on all devices and screens sizes available on Chrome Device Mode (Chrome DevTools) for simulaton.
## Technologies Used
### Languages Used
- [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)

6. [GitHub](https://github.com/)
    - GitHub is used to get the initial project template from Code Institute's repository. Then all of the incremental progress was documented through commits pushed to this ![GitHub repository](https://github.com/adrinecl/milestone-project2), where you can also find the code and files that belong the project. After being pushed from Git, the files are updated and the ![commit history](https://github.com/adrinecl/milestone-project2/commits/master) is available here. The website was also deployed to GitHub pages for the live demo.

## Testing
### Validator Testing
#### HTML
No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/).
The HTML validation passes without errors. There is one warning, with a suggestion that websites should not attempt to disable user zooming, which we do want so that we can keep the game area always visible.
- [W3C Markup Validator Results](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Ftcostain98.github.io%2FMilestone-2JS%2F).
#### CSS
No errors were found when passing through the official [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).
The CSS validation passes without errors (https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Ftcostain98.github.io%2FMilestone-2JS%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)
#### JavaScript
No errors were found when passing through [JSHint](https://jshint.com).
JSHint was used to validate the JavaScript for the project. The code passed validation without errors and with two warnings that we are using modern JavaScript features (async functions). If there is a need to support older browsers, it might be necessary to address these. JSHint does not provide a link to the results.

### Supported Screens and Browsers

- The game supports screen sizes from large desktops to small phones. The website layout changes to best fit on the screen it is displayed on.
