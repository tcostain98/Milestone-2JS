## About the Game

"The Memory Game" is an online game inspired by any classic memory game!
It is designed to entertain busy people that have no time for long gaming hours, full of involvement and commitment.
This game is the perfect break for the nostalgic busy millenial parent, but people of all ages will find it easy-going and enjoyable.
The game can be accessed by a link on the browser and different levels bring a little bit of challenge to the experience as the gamer progresses with the possibility to see their final score.

6. I would like to play a simple game, with a fairly short play time, but high entertaining value.

#### Strategy
<details>
<summary>Project Goals</summary>
The purpose of this project is to build an interactive website, using JavaScript. The website should have fun colors and provide good entertainment value. The user should feel good about playing the game and want to play it again immediately after or at a later time.
Although it is a simple game, in comparison to what is available today, this game has the nostalgic appeal of a classic memory game. In this project, the main goal is to make sure that the user decides to play the game and can the game mechanics.

<summary>Business Goals</summary>
The main goal of the website is to offer a game to attract players. 
The game is free, but this is a good way to test for features before potentially developing it further or even creating a paid version. Developing and deploying a game in this manner can save time, by just "shipping it" with the MVP (minimun viable product) and later iterating and improving it little by little.
**Audience:** the game targets mainly busy nostalgic "millenials" - people in the age range 25-40. 
However, people of all ages can enjoy the game. Basic knowledge of English is helpful to read the "instructions" , but not a requirement to play.
While most people all over the world alrealdy know somewhat how to play this game, due to the popularity of the memory games, our main audience consists of busy and nostalgic "millenial" parents. Therefore our marketing language is adapted to this group of people.

<summary>Customer Goals</summary>
Prospective players / first website visitors: get to know the game, decide to play and enjoy the playing experience. The game should instill the desire to play again immediately after a game session or at a later time.
One main goal is for the player to have such a fun experience that they will recommend it to friends and family, by sharing the link of the game.
In the future, after testing the free version, the players might be able to have a paid version available with extra fun features.
